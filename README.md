# BlueChain-MRV
BlueChain MRV is a mobile-first platform designed to bring trust, transparency, and accountability to blue carbon ecosystem restoration projects. It enables NGOs, communities, and auditors to collect, verify, and tokenize carbon sequestration data from mangroves, seagrass, and saltmarsh ecosystems.
